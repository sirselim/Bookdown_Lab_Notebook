# Chapter 3 {#chap3}

Here is another chapter...

## Cross Referencing Chapters

We can also cross reference chapters, see Chapter \@ref(chap1) and Chapter \@ref(chap2).

I should also be able to link to a section like this, see [this section](#chap2), and also this way [Chapter 2].

## Citing literature

Should also be able to use citations in text [@Benton_2015]. 

Does it keep poping in...? What about another citation, see [@Benton2013; @Benton2015a].
