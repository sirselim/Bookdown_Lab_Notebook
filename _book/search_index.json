A really nifty feature is that plotted figures get asigned a figure number which is able to be referenced in text (see Figure 4.1). We can create the same plot as before, but this time fit the regression model that we previously generated. We’ll plot the best fit line using the abline function. plot(cars, pch = 16, col = &#39;cadetblue&#39;) abline(lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)) Figure 4.2: Plot with regression model fitted. And again we can easily cross-ref the above plot, Figure 4.2. 4.6.4 Tables are also easy We can use the kable function from knitr (note that tables can also be captioned): require(knitr) ## Loading required package: knitr n &lt;- 100 x &lt;- rnorm(n) y &lt;- 2*x + rnorm(n) out &lt;- lm(y ~ x) kable(summary(out)$coef, digits=2, caption = &#39;An example table produced by knitr kable().&#39;) Table 4.1: An example table produced by knitr kable().
