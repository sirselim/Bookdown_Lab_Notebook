# Chapter 2 {#chap2}

Here is another chapter...

## Creating figures 

```{r foo, fig.cap='testing figure captions.'}
plot(cars)
```

Can cross-ref your figures, see Figure \@ref(fig:foo).^[You can also use footnotes in your book.]

Block quotes are a thing:

  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
