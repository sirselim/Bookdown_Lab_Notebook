# Chapter 2 {#chap2}

Here is another chapter...

## Creating figures 

```{r foo, fig.cap='testing figure captions.', fig.align = 'center'}
plot(cars)
```

Can cross-ref your figures, see Figure \@ref(fig:foo).^[You can also use footnotes in your book.]

Block quotes are a thing:

  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."

```{r irisPlot, fig.cap='Scatterplot with legend using iris data.', fig.align = 'center'}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, col = iris$Species, pch = 16, cex = 2)
legend(4.5, 7, 
       legend = c("setosa","versicolor","virginica"),
       col = c(1:3),
       lty = "solid")
```
